# Numerical Simulation and Benchmark Validation of Incompressible Lid-Driven Cavity Flow}

* Developed a 2D incompressible Navier–Stokes solver for the lid-driven cavity using the \textbf{vorticity–streamfunction}.
* Validated results against benchmark Ghia et al. data and analyzed Reynolds-number-dependent flow structures, including vortex formation and secondary eddies, using velocity profiles and streamline contours.
